# Apus Labs

## Overview

**Apus Labs** is a tool that generates a dataset containing questions and answers based on customizable templates. The tool uses various topics, job titles, keywords, and other placeholders to create unique content entries, each timestamped with the current date and time.

## Features

- Generate a customizable number of data entries with randomized content.
- Automatically populates placeholders with random selections from pre-defined arrays.
- Outputs the generated content in a `datasets.json` file.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dante4rt/Ramanode-Guides.git
   cd Ramanode-Guides/ApusLabs
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Make sure you have Node.js installed. Then, install the required packages by running:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Script**

   Start the script by running:

   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

2. **Specify the Number of Entries**

   The script will prompt you to enter the number of data entries you want to generate.

   ```bash
   How many data entries would you like to generate?
   ```

3. **Wait for Processing**

   The script will take a moment to generate the entries. Please wait until the process is complete.

4. **Check the Output**

   After processing, a `datasets.json` file will be created in the root directory, containing the generated content.

## Example

Here's a sample of what the `datasets.json` file might look like:

```json
[
  {
    "content": "Question: How does Sam utilize artificial intelligence and machine learning to enhance customer experience in his role as a Data Scientist? Answer: Sam leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve customer experience as a Data Scientist by implementing advanced analytics tools. This approach yields personalized customer interactions, enhancing user engagement and contributing to business growth.",
    "meta": {
      "time": "2024-08-01 10:15:30"
    }
  },
  {
    "content": "Question: What methods does Sam use with artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve customer experience as a Data Scientist? Answer: Sam applies artificial intelligence and machine learning to address customer experience in his position as a Data Scientist.
